# DORD
This program will go through darkorbit ranking pages and dump everything into .sql file.
Later this data can be used for various analysis, etc.

## Usage
>DO_Ranking_dumper.exe [SERVERCODE] [DOSID]

## Example output
I know ranks are in polish, maybe they'll be translated at some point in future.
