I know ranks are in polish, maybe they'll be translated at some point in future.

## Coming soon?
- Translate ranks
- Dump experience, honor and amount of aliens/players destroyed.
- Login via username/password (?)
- Automatically switch to next server on the list and keep dumping (?)
(?) = maybe, in far future
